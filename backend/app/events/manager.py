"""
Generic WebSocket Connection + Subscription Manager.

Generalizes the proven design of ``app.planning.ws_manager.PlanningConnectionManager``
(one in-process dict of open sockets, best-effort broadcast, dead-socket
cleanup) from "one bucket per sheet" to "one bucket per logical channel",
so any future module can reuse the exact same connect/subscribe/broadcast
machinery instead of writing its own manager (Phase 1 brief section 4:
"Use the existing Planning WebSocket implementation if it already contains
useful functionality... instead of creating a duplicate system").

Kept intentionally in-process (a plain dict, no external broker) for the
same reason ``PlanningConnectionManager`` is: this ERP runs as a single
FastAPI process today (see ``app.queue.worker`` for the same
single-process assumption elsewhere). See the module docstring on
:class:`ConnectionManager` for how this stays swappable later without a
rewrite (Phase 1 brief section 11).

Does NOT replace ``app.planning.ws_manager`` -- Planning keeps its own
manager and its own ``/planning/sheets/{sheet_id}/live`` route, untouched,
per the brief's "do not destroy working Planning functionality". This is
new, separate infrastructure for every OTHER module to use going forward,
and a candidate for Planning to migrate onto in a later integration phase.

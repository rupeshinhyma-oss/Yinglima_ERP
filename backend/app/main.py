"""
Application Entry Point.

Defines :func:`create_application`, the single FastAPI app factory used by
both the ASGI server (``uvicorn app.main:app``) and the test suite (which
can call ``create_application()`` directly to get a fresh app instance with
overridden settings/dependencies).

Startup/shutdown behavior, middleware order, CORS, exception handlers, and
router mounting are all wired together here and ONLY here, so the
composition root of the application is easy to find and reason about.

    Manage application startup and shutdown.

    Startup:
        - Configure structured logging before anything else logs.
        - Refuse to boot in production with a placeholder JWT secret.
        - Eagerly create the database engine (rather than lazily on first
          request) so connectivity problems surface immediately at boot,
          not on a random user's first request.
        - Start the background queue worker so jobs are processed immediately.
        - Start the background cache cleanup worker so expired cache
          entries are reclaimed even if nothing ever reads them again.
        - Start the background trash auto-purge worker so soft-deleted
          records past the 4-year retention window are permanently
          removed automatically, without anyone needing to trigger it.

    Shutdown:
        - Gracefully stop the background queue worker (waits for the
          currently-executing job to finish before stopping).
        - Stop the background cache cleanup worker.
        - Stop the background trash auto-purge worker.
        - Dispose of the database engine's connection pool cleanly.

    This is the correct, modern replacement for FastAPI's deprecated
    ``@app.on_event("startup")`` / ``@app.on_event("shutdown")`` decorators.
